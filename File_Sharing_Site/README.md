Welcome to my file-sharing website that I created for my Rapid Prototype and Creative Programming class I took at Washington University in St. Louis along with my partner.  The purpose of this project was to create a simple file sharing site that supports uploading, viewing, and deleting files associated with various users.  A user can login using one of the three usernames below:

The 3 login usernames are case sensitive:

sfsobol
imanolH
randomR

After logging in, users can perform all of the actions listed above by uploading a file from their computer, openning and viewing the file, as well as deleting the file.  Users cannot view or delete files that other users have uploaded.  Additionally, users can rename files they have already uploaded to the file system.  Users can perform every operation they could before renaming a file.
