NOTES: 
1) If you login as a guest when there have been no posts made, then you will see no posts or comments.
2) When editing or deleting comments/posts, make sure to input the title of the post or comment, not the original post/comment.
3) *LOGIN DETAILS* The admin password is "password" - very creative we know!

Creative Portion:

-Admin functionality - The admin does not have the limitations that a normal user does. It can delete or edit any post/comment. He is also a permanent user that can make posts or comments himself. We also added the functionality to remove users which we will discuss in a second. The admin can remove any user except themself! The admin can be logged into at the login screen using the password "password". A user can not use a username and "password" to log into admin normally.

-Remove Users - If a user wished to delete their account they can do so via the bottom of the home screen. They do this by entering their username. A user can only remove themselves and not other users in the database. The only person who can remove other users is the admin.
