Welcome, and thank you for visiting my brand-redesign project which I created for the Web Development class I took at Washington University in St. Louis.
The purpose of this project was to re-create and redesign a website homepage already developed by another company in a way that was more aesthetically appealing, 
and which better considered the target-audiences it was intended for.  This project contains two files, one with HTML code, and another with CSS code.
The website homepage which I decided to re-create is Alphabet Inc: https://abc.xyz/
While developing my own version of Alphabet's website homepage, my goal was to make it more aesthetically pleasing by incorporating an image which clearly depicts the structure of Google,
its parent and child companies, and where Alphabet fits within the corporate conglomerate.  I definitely took inspiration from the original website by using some of the same background
images and paragraphs, as well as the general layout of the homepage.  I determined that the original site is intended for two very different target-audiences:
(1) people who don't know what Alphabet is, and (2) Investors who may be interested in partnering with Alphabet.  In order to appeal to target-audience (1), 
I kept the original paragraph signed by Larry Page which describes Alphabet's origins and aspirations, and I added a section showing images of three of the most important leaders
within the conglomerate, and links for users in target-audience (1) to click and learn more about them.  In order to appeal to target-audience (2), I added a section which
invites ambitious and creative investors to partner with Alphabet.
