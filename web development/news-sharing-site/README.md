Our creative part of our project involves renaming a file that has been added to a users file system. At the bottom of the screen you can enter the name of a file in your user's system (that you already uploaded) that you want to rename. Then you can enter what you want to change the name to in the text field to the right. Lastly when you click submit, it will tell you if the name was successfuly changed and give you a button to redirect to the hub. You should see that the file's name has been changed. You can do every operation with the rename file that you had done before.
