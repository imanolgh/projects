Thank you for taking the time to look at the file-sharing site I created along with a partner.  The purpose of this project was to create a simple file sharing site that supports uploading, viewing, and deleting files associated with various users.  Users can login with the usernames listed below, and can perform all of the tasks listed above.  A user cannot login and view another user's files or delete them.  The only files the user has control over are files that the user themself uploads.

The 3 login usernames are case sensitive:

sfsobol
imanolH
randomR



Our creative part of our project involves renaming a file that has been added to a users file system.
At the bottom of the screen you can enter the name of a file in your user's system (that you already uploaded) that you want to rename.
Then you can enter what you want to change the name to in the text field to the right. 
Lastly when you click submit, it will tell you if the name was successfuly changed and give you a button to redirect to the hub.
You should see that the file's name has been changed.
You can do every operation with the renamed file that you could do before.
