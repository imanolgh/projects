FindMyFit is an app the I created along with 3 partners of mine which allows the user to register, login, upload images of their clothing, and generate outfits based on the weather and what colors they like using an algorithm that we built.  The app was built using Laravel, a weather API was used, and the app includes a social feature which allows users to follow other users to view their favorite outfits.  The features that I mainly worked on were allowing the user to input the weather and storing it to our MySQL database, displaying the logged in user's favorite outfits, and fleshing out the social feature.  The social feature was created using a many to many relationship between `followers` and `followings.`  Here is the link to the repository, where you can also access the url to test the web-app for yourself! https://github.com/imanolgh/FindMyFit.git:
