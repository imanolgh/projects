For an Object-Oriented Programming in C++ course, I created a Tic Tac Toe game as a command line C++ project.  Two players can play Tic Tac Toe until a winner is declared.  I practiced implementing object-oriented principles by creating a class and its associated member variables, member functions, and an object.
