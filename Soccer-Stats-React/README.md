Welcome to my Soccer-Stats-React project.  After creating the Soccer-Stats-Site primarily using javascript, I decided to re-create it in React, mainly for the purpose of building something in React for the first time.  I used the same API in this project as I did in the Soccer-Stats-Site Javascript project, so it was a challenging yet familiar transition from vanilla Javascript to React.  I do intend to add other features to this project in the near future as I improve my skills in React.  

Unfortunately as of the time of writing this, the github pages link I set up for this project isn't working properly, as it displays a plain white screen.  I am working on getting it fixed, and if you would like to see the finished product, I am more than happy to demo it for you over zoom.
