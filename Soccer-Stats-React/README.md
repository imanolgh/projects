Welcome to my Soccer-Stats-React project repository.  For this project, I recreated in React the Soccer_Standings_Site I originally coded in vanilla Javascript.  In Soccer-Stats-React, I fetched data from the same API I used in the Soccer_Standings_Site project to display the standings for Europe's top 5 soccer leagues when you click on them.  I plan on adding more features to this project, such as displaying the standings of the top-goalscorers, and perhaps other features that the API offers.  Unfortunately, the github pages link doesn't work for this website as of now, since whenever you click on it, all you see is a blank white webpage.  I am working on getting this fixed, and if you would like to see how the website looks, I am more than happy to demo it in-person or over zoom.
