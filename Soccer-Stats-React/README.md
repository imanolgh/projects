# Soccer Stats React
Welcome to my Soccer-Stats-React project repository. For this project, I used React to fetch data from this API: https://www.football-data.org/ to display the standings of Europe's top 5 soccer leagues when you click on their respective buttons. I plan on adding more features to this project, such as displaying the standings of the top-goalscorers, and perhaps other features that the API supports.
